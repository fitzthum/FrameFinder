# FrameFinder

A tool for searching movies for an image. Films are searched with a dynamic sample rate that increases as image similarity increases. Base implementation uses structural similarity with color images. I will probably add an option for searching as grayscale as well as some alternate metrics.

FrameFinder.py can search just one file, or an entire directory (recursively). Not as slow as it could be.
